Getting Started
---------------

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dmark/authzero/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [A First Timers Guide to an Open Source Project](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/)

Workflow
--------

Nothing has been adopted officially at this point, but [github-flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) is the likely candidate. Branch off master, make a thing, submit a PR. Master is always a functional version of the CLI.

Project Architecture
--------------------

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [oclif](https://oclif.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html)
